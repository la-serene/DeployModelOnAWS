In order to create EC2 instances, you need to have a VPC. It is isolated from other virtual networks 
in the AWS cloud. You can launch your AWS resources, such as **EC2 instances**, into your VPC. 
You can specify an IP address range for the VPC, add **Subnets**, associate **Security Groups**, and configure
**Route Tables**. Finally, you can connect your VPC to the internet via **Internet Gateway**.
